## Description:
This app will allow users to enter a movie title into the UI, and it will return a list of actors and actresses that appear in that movie. From there, the user can click on the name of an actor/actress, and a list of GIF’s associated with that actor/actress will appear. The app will allow users to save their favorite GIF’s in a publicly shared storage location.
